/* team_colors.js — the team-accent system for the 2027 team page (and anything
 * else that wants to wear a franchise's colours). Plain classic script, same
 * shape as charts.js/nav.js: an IIFE that hangs its API on `window` and also
 * CommonJS-exports so `node team_colors.js` can assert its own invariants.
 *
 * SOURCE. Every hex below is nbacolors.com's own data — the per-team pages are
 * JS-rendered from https://nbacolors.com/js/data.json, which is what this table
 * transcribes (colors[0] -> primary, colors[1] -> secondary). Spot-checked
 * against the rendered pages: Chicago #ce1141/#000000, San Antonio
 * #c4ced4/#000000. NO team is filled in from general knowledge; if one ever is,
 * mark it right here with an UNSOURCED comment on its line.
 *
 * WHY DERIVE INSTEAD OF USING THE BRAND HEX. These are colours picked for a
 * white jersey and a white broadcast graphic. On this site's #080b11 page the
 * Mavs' #00538C, the Nets' black and the Cavs' #860038 are all but invisible;
 * on the light theme the golds disappear the other way. So teamAccent/teamInk
 * keep the brand HUE (that is the part that reads as "the team") and move
 * lightness/chroma until the result clears a real contrast floor on the target
 * surface. Everything happens in OKLCh so that "keep the hue, move the
 * lightness" means what it says perceptually — HSL would swing the hue of the
 * deep navies and wash the reds.

  // 0.025 away, i.e. the same colour to the eye). The floor is PER ROLE, because
  // the two roles sit at different distances from a number.
  //
  // ACCENT 0.10 (~5 JND) is a mark NEXT TO the numbers, and it stays where it
  // is. It could not take the ink floor: at 0.18 eighteen of the sixty accents
  // would need more lightness displacement than the whole PUSH.accent budget —
  // nine on dark (ATL/POR 0.258, the other seven 0.300) and nine on light
  // (MIL 0.132 up to ATL/POR 0.234) — so they would lose their hue to the
  // fallback instead. A mark is not read as the sign of a number; it does not
  // have to buy that much room.
  //
  // INK 0.18 (~9 JND) is TEXT, one cell from a sign-coloured number, same size,

  // ink came out #ff9ba0 against --neg #ff6b6b, clearing the old floor and
  // still reading as one red family all the way down the table.
  // 0.18 is the largest floor all 30 teams hold on both themes while keeping
  // 4.5:1 text contrast AND their own hue — searched over the shipping
  // derivation, not picked. What binds it is not a red team: it is BOSTON on
  // dark, whose green tops out 0.1805 from --pos (#399d54, 4.84:1 on --grid)
  // within the lightness PUSH.ink allows it, with Milwaukee next at 0.1876.
  // Push the floor to 0.20 and those two stop wearing their own colour (see
  // FALLBACK in the self-check); 0.21 puts ten of the sixty inks there and 0.22
  // puts fifteen.
  // 0.18 IS A CEILING TO SIT AT, NOT A TARGET TO BEAT, and Boston is only the
  // first of two reasons. The second is that every step of this floor costs the
  // dark reds their chroma and their separation FROM EACH OTHER: max pairwise dE
  // across the nine-team red/wine family measures 0.039 at floor 0.10, 0.028 at
  // 0.16, 0.023 at 0.18 and 0.020 at 0.20, i.e. it walks INTO the ~0.02 JND
  // above rather than out of it (see derive()'s disclaimer). Raising the floor
  // does not make ink safer, it moves which colour the ink is unsafe against.

  // Distance from --text, the side of that trade. A RATCHET, not a target: it
  // pins what shipped so a future edit cannot quietly spend more of this axis.
  // It sits BELOW SIGN_DE and always will — partly because --text carries no
  // reserved meaning and a link is distinguished from body text by weight and
  // position as well as colour, and partly because it has to: at any sign floor
  // of 0.18 or more the dark reds are inside 0.13 of --text, so the two numbers
  // could not be equal even if that were wanted. Today's minima are ink 0.1212
  // (DET/dark #ffbebb) and accent 0.2334
  // (BKN,SAS/dark, which is the site accent itself) — so the ink pin has ~0.001
  // of slack and the accent pin ~0.03, both measured by the self-check below.
  // WORTH SAYING OUT LOUD, because it is what the 0.10 -> 0.18 ink change bought
  // and nobody costed it: those nine dark inks are now NEARER plain body text
  // (0.121) than they are to the sign colour they were moved off (0.181-0.183).
  // At the old 0.10 floor the closest any of the sixty came to --text was 0.186.
  // That is defensible — --text and a team link differ in weight, position and
  // underline, while a red number and a red name differ in nothing — but it is a

  //
  // WHAT HAPPENED. site.css darkened its light sign tokens to clear 4.5:1 on the
  // row-hover plate --panel-3 #e3ebf5 (--pos #11a06a -> #0d784f, L 0.624 ->
  // 0.507; --neg #d4393a -> #c72b2c, L 0.580 -> 0.543). That was a real
  // site-wide text-contrast bug and the fix is not up for revision — but it also
  // moved both sign colours into the MIDDLE of the light accent band
  // [0.46, 0.60]. With the search bounded by that band, TEN of the thirty light
  // accents could no longer get 0.10 away — ATL/POR 0.0803, DET/LAC 0.0804,
  // CHI/HOU/TOR 0.0888, MIA 0.0908, MIL 0.0942, BOS 0.0989 (the self-check named
  // only ATL because it asserts in alphabetical order) — and ELEVEN light inks
  // silently took the fallback, so thirteen of thirty franchises would have worn
  // the site accent in a roster column. Against the OLD tokens the same code
  // derived cleanly, both roles, with only the two greyscale brands falling back.
  //
  // WHY NOT WIDEN THE BAND (re-derivable by editing BAND above and re-running):
  //   [0.42, 0.60]  leaves BOS 0.0989 and MIL 0.0947 still colliding.
  //   [0.38, 0.62]  clears all ten — and drags INDIANA's accent, which never
  //                 collided with anything (sign gap 0.171), from #2b5894 down
  //                 to #13417b, 0.1863 from --text against TEXT_DE's 0.20.
  // That is the trap, and it is structural: widening the band moves the colours
  // that DO NOT NEED TO MOVE. What collides with a sign colour is reds (hue
  // 7-25) and greens (hue 149). What cannot afford lightness is the navies,
  // whose hue is 1-12 deg off --text's 259.5 and whose whole separation from
  // body text IS lightness — in the a/b plane they are 0.027 (MIN, DEN), 0.064
  // (UTA), 0.070 (IND), 0.082 (DAL) from it. The reds and greens sit 110-125 deg
  // away, 0.114-0.230 from --text in a/b before lightness is counted. The two
  // sets are disjoint, so a budget only the colliding colours ever spend costs
  // the navies exactly nothing — and on this repo's palette it costs the dark
  // theme nothing at all: all 60 dark colours come out bit-identical.
  //
  // The budget is a CAP ON BRAND DISTANCE, which is the only part of the band's
  // old double duty worth keeping here. Hue is preserved exactly, so lightness
  // displacement is the whole of how far a derived colour can get from the
  // franchise's. Each is a round number set just above the worst push that
  // ships: accent 0.096 (BOS, CHI, HOU and TOR on light) under 0.12, ink 0.222
  // (CLE on dark) under 0.24, leaving 0.024 and 0.018 of slack — four and three
  // of the 0.006 steps the walk moves in. That is enough that hex quantisation
  // cannot drop a franchise onto the fallback list, and deliberately not enough
  // to absorb a real palette move, which SHOULD surface as a named franchise
  // rather than as a colour quietly wandering off brand. Both worst pushes are
  // printed by the self-check, so the two numbers are re-derivable in one
  // command. A colour that cannot separate inside its budget DOES NOT GET A
  // BIGGER BUDGET — it takes the fallback and is named.

    // GREY_C, i.e. colours this file elsewhere refuses to call a hue. A green
    // team would be wearing slate.
    //
    // Step OUTWARD from where the contrast walk left off and take the NEAREST L
    // that clears the gap, so a colour spends the least brand-distance it can.
    // Both directions are tried: sign colours sit INSIDE the bands, so marching
    // to one edge can move a colour TOWARDS one (measured: at the top of the
    // dark accent band Boston green is 0.042 from --pos, worse than where it
    // started). The range is the PUSH budget, not the band — see PUSH. Every
    // candidate is re-checked against the contrast floor, so separation may not
    // buy itself illegibility; the budget is checked because separation may not
    // buy itself the franchise's identity either.
    // WHAT IT COSTS, so nobody "fixes" it later: 36 of the 120 colours move —
    // 9 dark inks and 10 light accents, all reds, wine or greens, plus 17 light
    // inks. That last group is bigger than the eye expects because at the ink
    // floor the mid-BLUES land inside it too: DAL, MEM, NYK, OKC, ORL and PHI
    // start 0.165-0.180 from light --pos, an 89-deg hue difference carried on
    // only ~0.11 of chroma. They deepen a step or two and are done.
    // On light the deep brands deepen and the bright ones brighten, whichever is
    // nearer (Hawks #E03A3E -> #ef494a accent, #7a0010 ink; Pistons #C8102E ->
    // #9e001f accent — both still plainly their own red, and 0.203 apart, twice
    // as far from each other as either is from --neg). On
    // dark the only legible direction away from --neg is LIGHTER, and sRGB sheds
    // chroma up there, so the ink lands pale: at the ink floor Chicago is
    // #ffbdbf, OKLCh chroma 0.076 against the brand #CE1141's 0.2115 — 36% of it
    // left. That is the honest price of a NAME that cannot be read as a negative
    // number; the accent keeps its bite (CHI dark #d31c45, chroma 0.2108,
    // essentially all of it) because it is held to a floor a mark can afford.
    // Two further prices are booked elsewhere: the nine dark reds become one ink
    // (derive()'s disclaimer) and they move nearer --text than --neg (TEXT_DE).

  //
  //   (a) teams whose brand hex is the same navy (UTA, WAS, MIN, NOP...) come
  //       out the same colour, because they ARE the same colour;
  //   (b) NINE franchises with nine DIFFERENT brand hexes — DET LAC MIA CLE CHI
  //       HOU TOR ATL POR — now share one dark ink. Five distinct hexes
  //       (#ffbebb #ffbdc0 #ffbcc8 #ffbdbf #ffbeb9), max pairwise dE 0.0227
  //       across the whole family and 32 of the 36 pairs under the ~0.02 JND
  //       this file treats as "the same colour". Cleveland's #860038 and
  //       Atlanta's #E03A3E are the widest pair in it and they are 0.0227 apart.
  //       teamInk CANNOT tell those two franchises apart on dark. Hue survives
  //       (7.0 deg to 23.8 deg, tracking the brands' 7.1-24.6), but chroma
  //       collapses from 0.16-0.21 to 0.075-0.079, and at that chroma the hue
  //       has nothing to ride on.
  //   (c) the same nine share a LIGHT ink too, now that they have one at all:
  //       #790016 #790023 #7b0033 #7b0022 #7a0010, max pairwise 0.0467 and 20 of
  //       the 36 pairs under 0.02. That is twice the spread of the dark family
  //       and it keeps 0.146-0.150 of chroma, so the wines and the fire-engines
  //       are at least different wines — but it is still one deep red per
  //       screen, not nine. It is an improvement on what it replaced, which was
  //       eleven franchises rendering in the identical site-accent blue.
  //
  // That is a consequence of the sign floor, not a bug to tune out, and it is
  // NOT the thing that caps SIGN_DE.ink at 0.18 — Boston's green is (see there).
  // It is the independent second reason 0.18 is a ceiling: the collapse gets
  // monotonically worse as the floor rises, so the fix for "these teams look
  // alike" is never a bigger floor.
  // Accents are unaffected and remain usable: on dark the same nine are 0.0816
  // apart at their widest, with #d32337 / #c53c51 / #bd4264 / #d31c45 / #e03a3e
  // still reading as five different reds. On LIGHT they are the most separated
  // this family gets anywhere in the file — 0.2028 at their widest, against
  // 0.0816 dark accent, 0.0467 light ink, 0.0227 dark ink — because the
  // separation walk sends the deep brands down and the bright ones up, so
  // Detroit's #9e001f and Chicago's #f1405c end up on opposite sides of --neg.
  // That spread is a by-product of "spend the least brand-distance you can", not
  // a goal; do not tune for it.
  // So: one team's ink is on screen at a time, by design. If a chart ever needs
  // to tell two teams apart, encode the difference some other way — a second
  // channel, or teamAccent, never teamInk; do not tune this.

    // ink floor by 0.0005 and Atlanta's light accent clears the mark floor by
    // 0.0001, so a nudge to --pos/--neg would put those on this list rather than

    // THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SIGN FLOOR. Every assertion above measures a derived

    // measures it against --text, which is the axis the 0.10 -> 0.18 ink change
    // actually spent (see TEXT_DE). Unguarded, that axis is free to be spent
    // again: the ink is walked lighter to escape dark --neg, and lighter on this
    // theme is where body text is, so the next raise trades one collision for
    // another and every check above still passes.
    //
    // A RATCHET pinned to what shipped, not a designed floor. Its job is to make
    // the trade visible and to fail the next raise loudly. It is also the guard
    // on PUSH: the separation walk is no longer fenced in by the placement band,
    // so "spend more lightness" is a thing it can now do, and THIS is what says
    // how much is too much. Deliberately NOT enforced inside walk() — a
    // constraint the search satisfies by construction is an assertion that
    // cannot fail, and this file may not have one of those.
    //
    // DELIBERATELY LAST, and it must stay last. Every check above names a cause
    // (this surface, this sign colour, this franchise, this hue); this one names
    // a CONSEQUENCE, and its margin is thin by construction — ink clears it by
    // 0.0012. Run it earlier and it front-runs the diagnostic failures: measured,
    // a 3-degree hue rotation of the sign-separation walk drags Cleveland's dark
    // ink to 0.1200 and this assertion fires instead of "hue drifted", reporting
    // the symptom of a mutation whose actual defect is named twenty lines up.
